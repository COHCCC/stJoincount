Description: stJoincount, a bioinformatics tool uses join count statistic for quantifying spatial correlation between clusters.
    This tool requires pre-processed spatial transcriptomics data, and either with user pre-defined clusters or standard louvain clusters from Cell Ranger outputs.
    The first part of the algorithm is rasterization of samples for join count analysis. It rasterize each cluster with calculated extent and resolution, then merge to form a large mosaic.
    The second part of the algorithm is to preform join count analysis on the integrated mosaic to quantify spatial correlation between clusters.
